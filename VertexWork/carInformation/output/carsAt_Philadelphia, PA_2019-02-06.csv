2000 Nissan Maxima,"$1,000","NEED TO SELL TODAY!!! Runs good, drives good. Both heat and AC work great. 19"" staggered Chip Foose rims. Everything works as it should. Normal rust around rear wheel wells. Will need exhaust but I drive it as is. Also comes with stock rims with ok tires. If it's still up its still available. Remember it's a $1500 car not a $15,000 car. Son wants a Subaru instead for when he gets his license. Have title and it's notarized so it can be taken with car and done at your leisure. Looking to sell before Friday. Low ball offers will b deleted so don't waste my time or yours. Thanks for reading.","251,000 miles",https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/930691683788506/,5
