2006 BMW 3 Series,"$9,000","There's a stern sort of luxury about this car. The interior is leather and mostly black, with brown-shoe brown-colored seats and door inserts. The details show high quality, particularly in the cargo area where the edges of the short-pile carpet are meticulously rolled out of sight and firmly secured. We like the cargo-loading flexibility: Lift the whole hatch lid or just the hinged glass. Both panels of the sunroof tilt, and the bigger one slides open. If the price, $40,190 as tested, seems high, you're probably thinking too much about the ""wagon"" part and not enough about ""sports."" This one includes Navigation System, and 16 all-season Bridgestone Turanzas. Run-flat tires are standard equipment; there is no spare.","118,000 miles",https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/361274527769471/,0
