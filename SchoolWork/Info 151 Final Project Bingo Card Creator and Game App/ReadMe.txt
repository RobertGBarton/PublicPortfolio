This is a project I did for Info 151, in it I created a Bingo Web application. Functions include 


- The ability to create you own bingo boards in terms of deciding what each tile is called (or just use default names)

- Automatic checking to prevent duplicate tile names  

- Randomly calls out random bingo numbers once ever 10 seconds (timer can all be paused)

- The ability to choose how many randomly generated bingo cards are created in addition to being able to choose which cards are player controlled and which autofill themselves when called

- The ability for players to fill out called bingo sheets by clicking on a called square

- Ability to print out each individual randomly generated bingo sheet.

- Automatic score board tracking for the different bingo boards, however player controlled sheets must manually click called squares to score.
