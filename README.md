A repository of my various works. 

Disclaimer 
The VertexWork was a webscraper built to scrape financial websites 2+ years ago and as such due to how its target websites's user interfaces have changed considerably since its inception thus it is unfortunately not functional at the moment. Currently I am working as a personal project to restore its functionality but if you wish it can give you glimpse into how I code.
